# Replica dribbble.com using only HTML, CSS, TAILWIND

## My aim

*The aim of this project was to replicate the landing pages of dribbble.com. I focused on multiple viewports, using Tailwind's default viewports: I replicated sm, md, lg, xl and worked on an edited vp of 1400px since their landing page at that resolution had some slight changes, mainly in the navbar and in the third section of the site, where we can find the unordered list with all the images.*

## What tools did I use

*As stated I replicated their landing pages using only HTML for the structure, CSS mainly for the animations and Tailwind (via CDN) for styling and to manage its different fixed viewports.*

## Sources

*In regards to the icons I used, I was able to get them through fontawesome.com. The images on the second section of the site, where we see the animated cards scrolling, are from unsplash.com, while the ones in the unordered list and the ones on the lower bottom were downloaded from dribbble.com.*

## Functionalities

*Since my project does not involve JavaScript, it only serves a visual purpouse. The searchbar is input with an icon placed on in using the position property. The navbar is different for almost every viewport, hence I used a lot of hidden and block properties. The cards moving in the top part of the site are animated to restart endlessly (I could not make the original loop because this project does not involve JS as stated). The list images in the middle of the site have an hover effect that puts a gradient background on top of them and shows the title of the image and two buttons that could make the author receive a like and with the other one the user could bookmark it. The list of images at the bottom of the page has an animation of bouncing on the X-axis with a scrollbar. Every link, every option on the navbar is clickable, but it will take you nowhere, except for the logo (->main page).*

## Status

*My project is completed.*
